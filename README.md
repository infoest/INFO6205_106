The universe of the Game of Life is an infinite, two-dimensional orthogonal grid of square cells, each of which is in one of two possible states, alive or dead, (or populated and unpopulated, respectively).Every cell interacts with its eight neighbours, which are the cells that are horizontally, vertically, or diagonally adjacent. At each step in time, the following transitions occur:
Any live cell with two or three neighbors survives.
Any dead cell with three live neighbors becomes a live cell.
All other live cells die in the next generation. Similarly, all other dead cells stay dead.

In this question, we generated the initial pattern through Genetic algorithm.GA is a method of searching for the optimal solution by simulating the process of natural evolution. The algorithms used by programs using genetic algorithms are basically the same. The key is to establish a suitable model for the current problem.
